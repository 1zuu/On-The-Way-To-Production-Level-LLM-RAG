# RAG University

Welcome to the **RAG University** repository! This repository contains code implementations for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, specifically designed for Language Model (LM) tasks. RAG models combine the strengths of both retrieval and generation approaches, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) in various natural language processing tasks.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a powerful paradigm that leverages pre-existing knowledge through retrieval mechanisms and generates contextually relevant responses. This repository focuses on providing a comprehensive set of codes and examples for implementing RAG models within the context of Large Language Models.

## Features

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Implement state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation techniques for enhancing the performance of language models.
- **Compatibility**: Codebase is compatible with popular language models, allowing easy integration into existing projects or workflows.
- **Example Implementations**: Explore example implementations and use cases to understand how RAG models can be applied to various language tasks.
